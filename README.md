# HCI-Frontend
React.js tutorial deliverable + custom final project home page

## Description
These code files comprise my deliverables for COSC 067 assignment A2.2. The [React.js tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY) deliverable can be found in the [tutorial folder] (https://github.com/benlehrburger/HCI-Frontend/tree/main/react-tutorial) while the deliverable I created as an extension of the tutorial lives under the [custom implementation] (https://github.com/benlehrburger/HCI-Frontend/tree/main/custom-implementation) directory.

## Troubleshooting
I developed my program with VSCode and transferred it to GitHub ad hoc. I was not able to upload the <i>node_modules</i> folder that accompanies React web apps because it consisted of too many files to upload in a reasonable amount of time. If you run into trouble running the app, I would suggest pulling a node_modules folder from another web-app into each project's directory (both the tutorial and custom implementation).
